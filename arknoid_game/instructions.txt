This is an Arknoid game with a twist.
You play with 3 balls and a paddle which the player can move.

The player has to direct the balls with the paddle so that the balls hit blocks.
The block will dissapear only if the color of the ball is different thatn the color of the block it hit.
The color of the ball changes to the color of the block it just hit, so be careful!

If a ball escapes below the paddle it will be lost. 
If all the balls escaped, the player loses and the game closes.

The player wins if they manage to destroy all the block.


use the following command to run the game:
cd arknoid_game
ant run
